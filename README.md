## Purpose

Our goal with this project was to practice all the features of react, such as react router, useContext, useEffect, etc. When you come from a background of working with vanilla Javascript, developing a "react-mindset" takes practice. This project enabled us to do that effectively.
During a month-long period, I and three other developers developed the project from start to finish. Trello was used for project management, while Git and GitHub were used for code sharing. Most of the App's functionality and architecture were developed by me. Vanilla CSS and Bootstrap were implemented for the styling.


## What does the application do?

What's in your fridge is a website where a user can enter what ingredients are in their refrigerator. Depending on what they enter, the application will provide them with recipes.  The recipe also includes a list of the missing ingredients, along with a link to where the ingredients can be purchased.

Users can also save their favorite recipes to the browser's local storage for later use.



## Installation
1. `git clone` the project.
1. `npm install` to install React and its dependencies.
1. `npm start` to run the project installed.
