This project was created with the intention of practicing all features of react, from react router, to using most of the most popular hooks *(useContext, useEffect,etc)*.
---

What's in your frige was made by three programmers using Trello for project management. I developed most of the App's functionality. Bootstrap and vanila css were used for the styling.

The reason behind the app is to have a website were the user can input whatever ingredients she/he has in their fridge, then according to their input, the app displays a list of recipes. The user also gets a list of the ingredients she is missing for the chosen recipe, with a link to where they can be bought.
---
The user can also save their favorite recipes and storage them in their browser's local storage.
