## Purpose

Our goal with this project was to practice all the features of react, such as react router, useContext, useEffect, etc. When you come from a background of working with vanilla Javascript, developing a "react-mindset" takes practice. This project enabled us to do that effectively.
During a month-long period, I and three other developers developed the project from start to finish. Trello was used for project management, while Git and GitHub were used for code sharing. Most of the App's functionality and architecture were developed by me. Vanilla CSS and Bootstrap were implemented for the styling.


## What problem does the application solve?

The idea behind the application is to have a website where a user can type in whatever ingredients are in their fridge. In return, the application will give them a list of recipes based on their input. In addition, he's given a list of the ingredients that are missing for the recipe, along with a link to where to buy them.

Users can also save their favorite recipes in the browser's local storage for later reference.


## Installation
1. `git clone` the project.
1. `npm install` to install React and its dependencies.
1. `npm start` to run the project installed.
